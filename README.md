# Resistor-DecadeBox
Resistor Decade Box 0 - 999999 Ohm

![Resistor Decade Box](https://github.com/vincent-himpe/Resistor-DecadeBox/blob/main/Documentation/3dsmall.png)

A Decade Resistor box using 2 Watt 1% resistors.( 3watt for the 1 ohm resistors )
The good quality boxes out there are very expensive. The "ebay" boxes invariably use sloppy switches and 0603 resistors that go -poof- if you just look at them.

So i decided to roll my own.

## Features:

- Hammond R2095 Enclosure
- Alpha Japan switches
- Yageo FMP300/FMP200  resistors (3 watt, 2 Watt 1% Metalfilm, flameproof)
- Cliff Electronics Binding Posts with 4mm Bana Jack
- OKW Topknob
- Double Sided PCB
- Front panel as PCB

## Layout

The Board is a 2 layer PCB that can easily be produced by the likes of JLCPCB or PCBway.  A full production pack (Gerber / NCdrill, BOM , Pick and place ) is available. You can send the ZIP files directly to JLCPCB.

## Assembly

The Bom is included in the PDF

## Source Files

All source files are available in Altium Format. That's what i know, have and use. Other CAD programs most likely can import those. So you can modify it if you want.
